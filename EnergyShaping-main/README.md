# RF-MPC

Representation-Free Model Predictive Control (RF-MPC) is a MATLAB simulation framework for dynamic legged robots. RF-MPC represents the orientation using the rotation matrix and thus does not have the singularity issue associated with the Euler angles. The linear dynamics on the rotation matrix is derived using variation-based linearization (VBL).

## Requirement
Basic: MATLAB and MATLAB optimization toolbox

Optional: qpSWIFT (can be obtained from https://github.com/qpSWIFT)

## Installation
There is no need to install external packages.

## Usage
navigate to the root directory and run the MAIN.m function

``` MATLAB
MAIN
```
### The Plant
The robot is modeled as a single rigid body (SRB). The SRB dynamics is defined in
``` MATLAB
...\fcns\dynamics_SRB.m
```

### VBL and vectorization
The code for variation-based linearization and vectorization steps is in
``` MATLAB
...\fcns_MPC\fcn_get_ABD_eta.m
```

### Quadratic Program (QP)
The code for QP formulation is in
``` MATLAB
...\fcns_MPC\fcn_get_QP_form_eta.m
```
The QP could be solved by either the MATLAB QP solver *quadprog* or a efficient QP solver qpSWIFT (coming soon!)
